# Team

The Pontem Team has a long and established reputation in the blockchain industry, having previously developed the DPoS DApp Crypti in 2014, founded the Wings DAO platform in 2016 and more recently in the last 2 years built the Dfinance project, a decentralized infrastructure dedicated to various financial and DeFi instruments and products designed for non technical people.

We will partner with Aptos to prioritize a roadmap of dApps exclusively deployed on the Aptos Blockchain with technical support from the Aptos team. This collaboration enables the success of native Move-based dApps on the Aptos Blockchain and strengthens the ecosystem for developers and users. You can read more about the partnership here.
