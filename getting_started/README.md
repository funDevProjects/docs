# Getting Started

Here is a guide on how to connect to the Pontem network and execute your first transaction. We will move PONT coins from account to another account using Move language.

## Connection to network

To connect to the network you can use UI or CLI.

Our testnet node deployed at the following IP address:

* `wss://testnet.pontem.network/ws`
  
Use provided address to configure UI and CLI:

* [How to configure UI](./ui.md)
* [How to configure CLI](./cli.md)

If you want to test Pontem network locally, see our [local node](./local_node.md) build guide. 

Create new account if needed in UI or CLI:

* [How to create account in UI](./ui.md#account-creation)
* [How to create account in CLI](./cli.md#account-creation)

Fund your account using [FAUCET](https://t.me/pontem_faucet_bot) if needed.

## Tools

Also, to continue with the current guide you need to install a compiler & package manager calling `Dove`.

See Dove installation guide:

* [How to install Dove](./../move_vm/compiler_&_toolset.md#Dove)

After you installed Dove and configured UI/CLI let's move to the next step.
