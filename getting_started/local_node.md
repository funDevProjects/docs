# Local Node

To build your local dev version use instructions from the [Pontem repository](https://github.com/pontem-network/pontem#substrate-move-vm).

## Connect to testnet

To up your own node and connect to existing testnet please use [bootstrap project](https://github.com/pontem-network/bootstrap):

* It's built using [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
* It allows you to run your own validator node easily.

Start with docker compose using documentation from [bootstrap](https://github.com/pontem-network/bootstrap) repository. 

## Become collator 

If you want to become a collator (validator), see [Staking](../staking/README.md) docs.
