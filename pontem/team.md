# The Team

The Pontem Team has a long and established reputation in the blockchain industry, having previously developed the DPoS DApp Crypti in 2014, founded the Wings DAO platform in 2016 and more recently in the last 2 years built the [Dfinance project](https://dfinance.co), a decentralized infrastructure dedicated to various financial and DeFi instruments and products designed for non technical people.

As part of our work on Dfinance we have been working closely with Diem (as recognized technical early adopters) using the Move language and the Move VM in order to run safe and flexible smart contracts. 

So far the tools we have developed using Move include but are not limited to:

* [Move Pallet](https://github.com/pontem-network/sp-move) for Substrate framework.
* [Move VM](https://github.com/pontem-network/sp-move-vm) adopted for Substrate WASM Runtime.
* [Cosmos SDK Move VM module](https://github.com/dfinance/dnode/tree/master/x/vm), brings Move VM to Cosmos SDK.
* [VS Code Plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PontemNetwork.move-language) to write modules and scripts for both Diem and Dfinance, Pontem network.
* [IntelliJ Plugin](https://github.com/dfinance/intellij-move) for Move language.
* [Move VM](https://github.com/dfinance/dvm) as a server.
* [Toolset](https://github.com/pontem-network/move-tools) for Move language: dissembler, resources viewer, language server, executor.
* [Move Book](https://move.pontem.network) - the first book about Move.
* [DeFi contracts](https://github.com/pontem-network/contracts) framework on Move language.
