# PONT coin & Tokenomics

## Token Utility

The PONT coin will serve a similar function to other blockchain tokens such as DOT in that it will **align incentives across actors on the network and reward good behaviour**.

Some of the initial utility features of the token are as follows:

{% hint style="success" %}
* Payment of gas fees for the Move VM and transaction validation.
* Collateral or security deposits for bridge nodes (similar to the Polkadot Parachain auctions and Cosmos IBC auctions).
* Staking delegators and delegates (rewarding voters and delegators for participating in governance)
{% endhint %}
