# PONT coin & Tokenomics

## Token Utility

The PONT coin will serve a similar function to other blockchain tokens such as DOT in that it will **align incentives across actors on the network and reward good behaviour**.

PONT token has 10 decimals, meaning 1 PONT it's really 10000000000 planck units (planck is similar to wei in Polkadot networks).

Some of the initial utility features of the token are as follows:

* Payment of gas fees for the Move VM and transaction validation.
* As reward for crowdloans participants of parachain auctions on Polkadot/Kusama.
* Staking (collators/nominators) and governance (rewarding voters and collators/nominators for participating in governance).
{% endhint %}
